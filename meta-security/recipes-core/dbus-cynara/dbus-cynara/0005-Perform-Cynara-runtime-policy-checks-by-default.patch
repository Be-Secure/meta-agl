Subject: [PATCH 5/5] Perform Cynara runtime policy checks by default
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This change introduces http://tizen.org/privilege/internal/dbus privilege
which is supposed to be available only to trusted system resources.
Checks for this privilege are used in place of certain allow rules to
make security policy more strict.

For system bus sending and receiving signals now requires
http://tizen.org/privilege/internal/dbus privilege. Requesting name
ownership and sending methods is still denied by default.

For session bus http://tizen.org/privilege/internal/dbus privilege
is now required for requesting name, calling methods, sending and receiving
signals.

Services are supposed to override these default settings to implement their
own security policy.
